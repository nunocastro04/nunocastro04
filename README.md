<h3 align=center> Hi there 👋, I'm Nuno</h3>
<h4>Well... how would I introduce myself?? 🤔</h5>
<h4>Oh I know, hey I'm a junior full stack developer with a solid knowledge in Java, JS, C and HTML</h5>
<h4>🌍 Born in Mafra but raised in Cascais, I set sail in the world of programming.</h5>
<h4>It all started in 2022 at college 🏫 when we were introduced to C and I couldnt understand any of it, just the basics.<br> But as time ⏲ went on I still couldnt grasp it. After some time I dropped out and decided to learn programming elsewhere that's when I found Code for All_ and they opened my eyes 👀 to the world of programming with JS, Java and HTML. And now I am here introducing myself to you 😄
